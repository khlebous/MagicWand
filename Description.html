<h2>Magic Wand</h2>
	<p>The aim is to implement application with floating rectangles. Not described issues should imitate example application</p>

	<h3>Basic functionality - part I</h3>
	<ul>
		<li>There are 20 rectangles floating on a screen appearing every 100 ms. Their start position is always the same position as a mouse cursor, however they have different velocity and colors. Every time application is opened, all variables are different.</li>
		<li>After 5 seconds, each window disapears.</li>
		<li>All rectangles are top - most </li>
		<li>All rectangles bounces from the screen - they should never leave it</li>
		<li>Pressing ALT-F4 should close last created rectangle</li>
		<li>All rectangles should be windows without top controls. They should also not be visible on a menu</li>
		<li>There are no tips, as they varies on technology used.</li>
		<li>Scoring:
		<ul>
			<li>Generate 20 rectangles in the mouse position with different colors. Pressing ALT-F4 should close last window: 4 points<br />
			<li>Add movement, bounce and 5 seconds timeout, after which rectangle disapears - 4 points</li>
		</ul>
		</li>
	</ul>
	
	<h3>Extended functionality - part II</h3>
	<ul>
	<li>We will be changing rectangle windows to either a circular windows or an equilateral polygon (3-7 edges)</li>
	<li>Opacity is constantly changing from 100% to 0% and then back to 100% - step varies depending on a window</li>
	<li>In case of windows in a shape of equilateral polygons, they are constantly rotating</li>
	<li>Scoring:
	<ul>
		<li>Change windows shapes from rectangle to circle or polygon - 4 points</li>
		<li>Add constantly changing opacity - 4 points</li>
		<li>Add rotation - 4 points</li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
